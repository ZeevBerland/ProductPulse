# Email Draft to Professor Zuckerman

**Subject:** Assignment #1 - Alternative Submission Request (Custom AI Application instead of GPT)

---

Dear Professor Zuckerman,

I am writing regarding Assignment #1 (Custom GPTs). Instead of creating a Custom GPT or Gem, I have built a full AI-powered product feedback intelligence platform called **ProductPulse** that I believe demonstrates a deeper integration of AI into product management workflows.

## Why ProductPulse Qualifies

The assignment states that we "may choose the platform you wish to work with (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini)." ProductPulse uses **Google Gemini 3** as its AI engine to:

- Analyze sentiment of user feedback (-1 to +1 scale)
- Score relevance to tracked keywords/competitors (0-100%)
- Extract entities (products, features, competitors mentioned)
- Cluster themes (pricing, UX, bugs, features, support, etc.)
- Rate actionability (High/Medium/Low priority)
- Suggest keywords and competitors to track

## Comparison with Custom GPT

| Aspect | Custom GPT | ProductPulse |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| AI Integration | Prompt engineering | Full-stack AI application |
| Interface | Conversation-based | Dashboard with visualizations |
| Data Input | Manual per conversation | Automated RSS monitoring |
| Output | Text responses | Charts, analytics, CSV exports |
| Persistence | None | Real-time database |
| Workflow Support | Reactive (user asks) | Proactive (auto-monitors) |

## The Workflow It Supports

ProductPulse automates the workflow of **monitoring public product conversations** - a task that typically takes product managers hours per week:

1. **Before:** Manually browse Reddit, HN, Stack Overflow for mentions
2. **After:** AI automatically fetches, analyzes, and surfaces actionable insights

## What I Will Submit

- Link to the deployed application (or video demo)
- Full documentation (goal, description, detailed instructions)
- Usability testing results with 3-5 participants
- Reflection on the development and testing process

Would this be an acceptable alternative submission? I'm happy to discuss further or provide a demo if needed.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
