## Script Outline

### 0:00 - 0:30 | Introduction
**[Show: ProductPulse landing page or dashboard]**

"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is ProductPulse - an AI-powered feedback intelligence platform I built for product managers.

The problem: Product managers spend hours every week manually monitoring Reddit, Hacker News, and forums for mentions of their product and competitors. This is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often misses important feedback.

ProductPulse solves this by using Google Gemini AI to automatically monitor, analyze, and surface actionable insights."

### 0:30 - 1:30 | Create a Project with AI Assistance
**[Show: New Project page]**

"Let me show you how it works. I'll create a new project.

[Type product name and description]

Now watch what happens when I click 'Suggest Keywords' - the AI analyzes my product description and recommends relevant tracking terms.

[Click Suggest Keywords, show results]

I can also discover competitors with AI. Let me click 'Discover Competitors'.

[Click, show competitor suggestions]

The AI identified [X] competitors in my space. I'll select a few and add them."

### 1:30 - 2:15 | Add AI-Suggested Sources
**[Show: Sources section]**

"Now I need data sources. Instead of manually finding RSS feeds, I click 'Suggest Sources'.

[Click Suggest Sources]

The AI recommends relevant subreddits, Hacker News queries, Stack Exchange tags, and Discourse forums. Each shows a relevance score.

I'll select these [X] sources and add them to my project.

[Select and add sources]"

### 2:15 - 3:15 | Fetch and AI Analysis
**[Show: Fetch process]**

"Now let's fetch content. I'll click 'Fetch Now'.

[Click Fetch Now, show progress]

ProductPulse is pulling content from all sources. Behind the scenes, Gemini 3 is analyzing each item for:
- Sentiment: Is it positive, negative, or neutral?
- Relevance: How related is it to my tracked keywords?
- Entities: What products or features are mentioned?
- Themes: Is this about pricing, UX, bugs, or features?
- Actionability: Should I act on this now?

[Show analysis completing]"

### 3:15 - 4:15 | Review Insights and Filters
**[Show: Insights page]**

"Here are my analyzed insights. Each card shows:
- The original content and link
- Sentiment score and color-coded label
- Relevance percentage
- Extracted themes as badges
- Actionability rating

[Scroll through insights]

I can filter by sentiment - let me find negative feedback.

[Apply negative filter]

Or filter by competitor mentions to see what people say about [competitor name].

[Apply competitor filter]

The Analytics tab shows trends over time, competitor mention frequency, and theme evolution.

[Show Analytics page briefly]"

### 4:15 - 4:45 | Export and Value Proposition
**[Show: Export]**

"I can export all insights to CSV for team sharing or further analysis.

[Click Export]

This entire workflow - which used to take me 5+ hours per week - now takes minutes. The AI does the heavy lifting of monitoring, analyzing, and prioritizing.

---

### 4:45 - 5:00 | Conclusion
**[Show: Dashboard overview]**

"ProductPulse demonstrates how AI can transform product management workflows. Instead of reactive monitoring, PMs get proactive intelligence.

The code is open source on GitHub, and it uses Google Gemini 3 for all AI features.

Thank you for watching!"
